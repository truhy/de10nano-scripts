Changes made to socfpga_de10_nano_defconfig:

Embed the U-Boot SPL devicetree .dtb to the end of the elf.  Note, U-Boot has it's own separate devicetree
This enables to load only a single elf file (u-boot-spl), without needing to load a separate .dtb file when debugging in OpenOCD or GDB
CONFIG_OF_EMBED=y

Disable SD card device driver.  We don't want anything to boot from SD card, even when a card is inserted
CONFIG_MMC_DW=n
